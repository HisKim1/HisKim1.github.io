        Hi! I'm expected to graduate with a bachelor's degree this summer and will begin my master's studies in Environment and Energy Engineering at GIST, under the supervision of Prof. Jinho Yoon. My majors are Computer Science and Environmental Engineering with a minor in Mathematics — the most challenging, but also the one I enjoy the most! <br>

        I'm especially interested in understanding the physics behind deep learning weather/climate models and making them more trustworthy.
